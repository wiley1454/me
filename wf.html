                    In Summer 2017, I spent 4 months with the Creative Team 
                    at WildFusion Limited as a Creative Design Intern at  [ Ikoyi, Lagos ]. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was thrilling to work with my talented colleagues and 
                    Creative Directors on Big Brands such as Lafarge, Unilever,
                    First Bank, FreshYo and many others.     </p>
